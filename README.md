Our task is to create a website for Vidyodaya that is more appealing and user-friendly for new visitors.

Requested Features:

- Make the website more kid-friendly, yet contains tribal elements
- Improve the navigation to various web pages
- Create a login for admins, and allow new admins to be created
- Allow admins to add reports and articles to the site

## Challenges We Ran Into
Initially we started out working on the Zuri's Circle project which we thought was a Website project. When we understood that it was supposed to be an Mobile App we looked for solutions to build it with our current skillsets. Ultimately we determined we were not currently up to the challenge of picking up new languages so quickly, and we ended up changing to the Vidyodaya project. This left us with only 4 days to complete the project instead of the original 7 days.
