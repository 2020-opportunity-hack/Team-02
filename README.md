# Team-02: Zuri's Circle
## About Zuri's Circle

Zuri's Circle is aimed at helping homeless with their essential needs (water, food and clothing), assisting families and elderly with furniture, everyday essentials, school supplies, uniforms and food as needed, also by directing them to a database of other resources that can provide rent, medical, and dental assistance.  

Our task is to create a Zuriâ€™s Circle App that takes donations, allows volunteers to sign up for events, and connects people to support. 

Requested Features:
:bulb: Send a push notification to any person who has the app
:bulb: Google or Facebook Login
:bulb: Donation through PayPal
:bulb: Volunteer signup
:bulb: Send a message back

This will help Zuri's Circle by making it easier to accept donations, allow for sign-ups for volunteering, and make it easier to see when and where they have a program or resource available.
